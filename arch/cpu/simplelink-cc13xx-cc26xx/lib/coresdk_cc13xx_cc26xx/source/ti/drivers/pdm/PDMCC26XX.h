 *  @file       PDMCC26XX.h
 *
 *  @brief      PDM driver implementation for a CC26XX PDM controller.
 *
 *  The PDM header file should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/pdm/PDMCC26XX.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 * # Overview #
 * This driver is written to be able to perform continuous audio streaming
 * of PDM data from a microphone. It also controls one DIO to be able
 * to turn on power to the microphone.
 *
 * This PDM driver performs two operations that requires processing
 * - PDM to PCM conversion
 * - PCM compression (optional)
 *
 * When producing 16kHz output, the driver is configured to process 256 bytes
 * of PDM data provided by the I2S hardware module at a time, sampled at
 * 1.024 Mbps. The PDM driver consequently receives such a buffer approximately
 * every 2ms.
 * A frame of ::PDMCC26XX_Params.retBufSizeInBytes PCM data bytes minus four
 * metadata bytes is provided to the application after being filled by all or
 * part of one or more 64 byte buffers of PCM data derived from the 256 bytes
 * of PDM data. The resulting PCM frame provided to the application is a 16bit
 * PCM signal sampled at 16kHz.
 *
 * When providing 8kHz PCM output, the driver processes 512 bytes of PDM data
 * at a time. At a sample rate of 1.024 Mbps, this yields a PDM buffer to
 * process ever 4ms. These 512 bytes of PDM data are filtered and decimated
 * to yield 64 bytes of PCM output.
 *
 * The driver creates a separate task to run in.
 *
 * @note    The application must allow for the PDM driver task to run often enough to process the data received from
 *          I2S driver approximately every 2ms in 16kHz PCM output mode or 4ms in 8kHz PCM output mode.
 *          The amount of processing is approximately equal but the latency requirements differ.
 *
 * The driver currently only samples on a single edge of the I2S clock.
 *
 * # General Behaviour #
 * Before using PDM on CC26XX:
 *   - The PDM driver is initialized by calling ::PDMCC26XX_init(). This should
 *     be done in main before BIOS_start() is called.
 *   - The PDM system dependencies are set by calling ::PDMCC26XX_open().
 *     The driver is also marked as taken. Prior to this the system should call ::PDMCC26XX_init().
 *     The driver also automatically allocates the first PDMCC26XX_pcmBuffer of the size
 *     specified by the application in ::PDMCC26XX_Params.retBufSizeInBytes.
 *     This call also reserves the pins for the microphone signal and power specified in the board file.
 *   - Do not start steaming data until the device is running off of the high frequency external oscilator (XOSC_HF).
 *     The XOSC_HF is required to generate a jitter-free I2S audio clock. When switching to XOSC_HF, several SCLK_HF clock
 *     cycles and thus audio clock cycles are missed. Both jitter and missing audio clock cycles causes severe degredation
 *     in audio noise performance!
 *     After booting, the device runs off of the high frequency RC oscillator (RCOSC_HF) by default. Set a dependency
 *     on the XOSC_HF to turn it on and switch to it when it is ready. Register a power notification for the XOSC_HF having switched.
 *     Wait until after this notification occurs to call PDMCC26XX_startStream(). When waking up from standby, the XOSC_HF will automatically
 *     be turned on and switched to if the dependency was set before going into standby. Again, only call PDMCC26XX_startStream()
 *     after the application was notified of the switch to XOSC_HF. PDMCC26XX_open() may be called before running off of XOSC_HF.
 *
 * While using PDM on CC26XX:
 *   - When PDMCC26XX_open() is called, the driver allocates one PCM buffer on the heap and the I2S module tries to allocate enough memory for its PDM buffers.
 *   - When PDMCC26XX_startStream() is called, the I2S driver starts processing the pdm stream,
 *     the PDM driver resets the internal state of the decimation filter, sets the driver to drop the first
 *     MAX(PDM_DECIMATION_STARTUP_DELAY_IN_SAMPLES, ::PDMCC26XX_Params.startupDelayWithClockInSamples),
 *     and resets the metaData (including the sequence number). The driver will keep allocating PDMCC26XX_pcmBuffers on the heap
 *     and keep them in a queue until they are requested by the application.
 *     From now on, callbacks are generated every time a buffer is ready; if callbacks are asked for.
 *   - Data is acquired by the application by calling ::PDMCC26XX_requestBuffer().
 *     After processing the buffer, the application is responsible for freeing the memory allocated
 *     for the buffer in a timely manner.
 *   - The stream is stopped when ::PDMCC26XX_stopStream() is called. Note that
 *     this is a blocking call that will wait until the I2S hardware has gracefully
 *     shut down. This will take at most 4ms, unless an error occurs.
 *     Any PCM buffers remaining must be released by the application as usual.
 *     The system is allowed to enter standby again after PDMCC26XX_stopStream() is called.
 *   - The memory held by the I2S module is freed upon calling PDMCC26XX_close(). Any completed PCM buffers must be processed and freed by the application.
 *
 * After PDM operation has ended:
 *   - Release system dependencies and free up all memory on the heap allocated for the PDM driver by calling PDMCC26XX_close().
 *
 * # Error Handling #
 *  The application is notified of errors via the registered callback function.
 *
 * ## Heap Full #
 *  If the application fails to consume PCM buffers fast enough and the heap is full
 *  when driver tries to allocate a new buffer, the driver will drop all new incoming data until a buffer
 *  can be allocated to store it. Data is dropped one PCM data buffer at a time , even though it is streamed
 *  into the device and copied into the buffer in smaller chunks.
 *  This is done to keep the data expected in any buffer in sync with the sequence number
 *  of the buffer that keeps incrementing even when the buffer is dopped. The application may keep track
 *  of lost frames by comparing sequence numbers.
 *
 *  Hence, the PDM stream will never have a buffer overflow, but if the memory available in the
 *  heap is too low it may lose frames because because there is nowhere to put the incoming
 *
 *  If the heap frees up again and the PDM task runs, it will automatically resume normal operation again.
 *  The only application-observable difference is the incremented version number.
 *
 * ## PDM Task Not Serviced In Time #
 *  The application must permit the PDM task to run often enough that it can process a PDM buffer every 2ms on average.
 *  If the application requires a larger contiguous segment of processing time, the I2S hwi may run out of empty buffers to fill
 *  with new PDM data. When the I2S driver runs out of empty PDM buffers it will pop a buffer from the full buffer queue and overwrite
 *  its old data. The I2S driver notifies the PDM driver that it has dropped a PDM buffer. Once it runs again, the PDM driver will drop
 *  enough additional PCM samples such that the sequence numbers of the PCM buffers remain aligned with the data in the audio stream.
 *  The latency between when the PDM task was last serviced and when it must be serviced again to avoid losing data is specified by
 *  ::PDMCC26XX_Params::pdmBufferQueueDepth. This permitted latency increases by 2ms or 4ms for each increment of pdmBufferQueueDepth.
 *
 * ## PDMCC26XX_open Failing #
 *  ::PDMCC26XX_open() returns NULL and rolls back all prior parts of the initialisation if any part of the initialisation fails.
 *  The following can cause ::PDMCC26XX_open() to fail:
 *      - The driver is already open
 *      - The heap is full when the application calls ::PDMCC26XX_open()
 *      - The PIN driver could not allocate the requested pins for the PDM driver
 *      - The I2S driver failed to initialise
 *
 * ## PDMCC26XX_startStream Failing #
 *  ::PDMCC26XX_startStream() returns false if it fails.
 *  The following can cause ::PDMCC26XX_startStream() to fail:
 *      - The driver is already streaming
 *      - The I2S driver could not successfully start reading the pdm stream
 *      - The I2S driver could not allocate enough memory for the specified
 *        number of PDM buffers
 *
 * ## PDMCC26XX_stopStream Failing #
 *  ::PDMCC26XX_stopStream() returns false if it fails.
 *  The following can cause ::PDMCC26XX_stopStream() to fail:
 *      - The driver is not currently streaming
 *
 * # Power Management #
 *  The PDMCC26XX driver sets a power constraint while streaming to keep
 *  the device out of standby. When the stream has ended, the power constraint
 *  is released.
 *
 *  The following statements are valid:
 *    - After ::PDMCC26XX_open(): the device is still allowed to enter standby.
 *    - During ::PDMCC26XX_startStream(): the device cannot enter standby.
 *    - After ::PDMCC26XX_stopStream() succeeds: the device can enter standby.
 *    - If ::PDMCC26XX_close() is called: the device can enter standby.
 *
 * # Standard Use Case #
 *  The standard use case involves calling PDMCC26XX_open() once and calling PDMCC26XX_startStream() and PDMCC26XX_stopStream()
 *  to start and stop the stream as needed. PDMCC26XX_close() is called when the PDM driver will no longer be needed again.
 *  In order for the PDM driver task to run, the application pends on a semaphore that is posted in the ::PDMCC26XX_Params::callbackFxn.
 *  In this example, the application requests 128 buffers. In a real application, the process of pending on a semaphore, requesting a buffer,
 *  and freeing it would be repeated as often as required by the use case before stopping the stream.

# 8kHz PCM output #
By default, the PCM output of the driver has a sampling frequency of fs = 16kHz.
There is an alternate signal processing chain that returns PCM output with fs = 8kHz.
This example shows how to alter the standard use-case to set this up.
