 *  @brief  PDM utility includes helper functions for configuring the CC26XX I2S
 *          controller.
 *
 *  The PDMCC26XX utility header file should be included in an application as

 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/pdm/PDMCC26XX_util.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 * # Overview #
 * This utility file is written specifically for the I2S module on CC26XX. The
 * user should be aware that although this HW module is called I2S it is a
 * highly configurable audio interface module. I2S is only one of many
 * configurations.

 *  @brief  Function for requesting buffer.
 *
 *  In ::PDMCC26XX_I2S_MODE_BLOCKING, PDMCC26XX_I2S_requestBuffer will block task
 *  execution until at least one buffer is ready.
 *
 *  In ::PDMCC26XX_I2S_CALLBACK_MODE, PDMCC26XX_I2S_requestBuffer returns immediately
 *  if no buffer is available. The caller is notified through events each time
 *  a buffer is available.
 *
 *  This function takes as an argument a pointer to a struct which contains
 *  4 pointers. There are two pairs; one for Input and one for Output.
 *  If input is defined then the input buffer pointer will point to the
 *  new input buffer. Same goes for output and the output buffer pointer.
 *  The caller is not expected to allocate memory for the buffer as no copy
 *  is performed. The other two pointers must be maintained by the caller until
 *  it is ready to call PDMCC26XX_I2S_releaseBuffer().
 *
 *  @pre    PDMCC26XX_I2S_open() and PDMCC26XX_I2S_startStream() has to be called first.
