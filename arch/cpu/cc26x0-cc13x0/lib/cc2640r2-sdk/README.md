This is a git-versioned subset and slightly modified version of TI's SIMPLELINK-CC2640R2-SDK.

This repository's sole purpose is to provide the SDK as a submodule for the [Contiki-NG Operating System](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/).

New versions will only appear in this repository only if and when Contiki-NG's CC2640R2 port needs to use them.

Modifications (for current and upcoming versions):

* Only files used by Contiki are included here. Documentation and files related to IAR and CCS have been removed.
* Line-endings have been converted to Unix
* File permissions have been changed to 644

All sources are and will remain otherwise intact, except in case where modifications are required by Contiki.

SIMPLELINK-CC2640R2-SDK is distributed by TI. If you are looking for the latest version, do not clone this repository. You should download the latest version from TI's web site instead.

Do not open pulls / issues on this repository, unless they are immediately related to using this SDK with Contiki-NG.
